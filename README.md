## Issue

ðŸ’¡ **Q:** **Pyppeteer doesn't work in docker image**

> Because Pyppeteer uses the `--no-sandbox` parameter to execute chromium, the docker image needs to install some dependencies
> https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer/issues/194#issuecomment-739012427

ðŸ’¡ **Q:** **Pyppeteer doesn't support ARM**
 
> I added support for arm and arm64 platforms to the source code of `pyppeteer` to solve this problem.
